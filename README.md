# 🧠 Clash Royale Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my machine learning and AI portfolio, inspired by Clash Royale and built on top of my experience as a Business Intelligence Manager. This repository documents my step-by-step journey into machine learning, integrating tools like Power BI, SQL Server, and Microsoft Fabric—while keeping things fun with a Clash Royale twist. Each project builds on the last, showcasing real-world applications and technical growth.

## 🧠 Why Clash Royale?

Clash Royale is a perfect metaphor for machine learning:
- 🃏 Cards = Features
- 🧠 Strategy = Model logic
- 🏆 Win rate = Model accuracy
- 🔁 Training = Reinforcement learning

Each project draws parallels between game mechanics and ML concepts to make learning more intuitive and engaging.
