# 🃏 Card Classifier – Clash Royale ML Foundations

This is the first project in my "From BI to AI" portfolio. It introduces basic machine learning concepts using Clash Royale card data. The goal is to build a simple classifier that predicts the type of a card—Troop, Spell, or Building—based on its stats.
