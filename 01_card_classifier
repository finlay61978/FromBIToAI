# 🃏 Card Classifier – Clash Royale ML Foundations

This project is the first step in my "From BI to AI" journey. It introduces basic machine learning concepts through a fun and familiar lens: Clash Royale. The goal is to build a simple classifier that predicts the type of a card (Troop, Spell, or Building) based on its stats.
